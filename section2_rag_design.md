# üìÑ Section 2: RAG System Design for EMR Generation

This section outlines a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system to transform raw medical transcripts into structured, clinician-grade EMR notes. We base the note structure on the style exemplified in `./example_notes/Simple EMR Note.pdf`.

---

## 1. üóÇ Data Sources for Retrieval

The retrieval system will draw from several trusted, high-value medical knowledge sources to ground EMR generation in clinical accuracy:

- **SNOMED CT**: A comprehensive clinical terminology for diagnosis, symptoms, and procedures. Useful for mapping colloquial patient language to standardized medical terms.
- **UMLS Metathesaurus**: Aggregates multiple medical ontologies. Excellent for resolving synonyms, abbreviations, and context-aware entity linking.
- **PubMed abstracts (via EBM/NLP subsets)**: Retrieval of guideline-backed rationale, treatment evidence, or summaries for less common conditions.
- **CDC/NIH Guidelines**: For standard-of-care practices (e.g., immunization, screening).
- **Patient-specific history** (if available): Past diagnoses, medication records, and recent labs can dramatically improve contextual relevance and reduce hallucination risk.

Justification: Structured ontologies like SNOMED/UMLS are ideal for entity resolution and section templating, while medical guidelines and history provide personalized or evidence-based augmentation.

### üí° Preprocessing without LLMs:
- **Regex + spaCy/MedSpaCy** to extract entities like medications, symptoms, durations
- **Rule-based segmenter** (e.g., detect question ‚Üí answer boundaries)

### üí° Retrieval:
- Embed queries using BioBERT or MiniLM on transcript snippets
- Use **hybrid search**: lexical (BM25) + dense (FAISS vector index)

### üí° Generation:
- Prompt LLM with: `[transcript entities + top-k retrieved snippets]`
- Instruction tuning or few-shot example templates modeled on Simple EMR note

## 3. üß™ Evaluation and Optimization

### üìä Metrics

- **ROUGE-L** and **BLEU**: surface-level overlap with ground truth (useful for regression tests)
- **BERTScore** or **CheXpert-label alignment**: semantic similarity
- **Exact match on ICD-10 codes / medication names**
- **Hallucination rate**: presence of unsubstantiated statements

### üßç Human-in-the-Loop Evaluation

- Clinician review checklist:
  - Are symptoms accurately captured?
  - Are recommended actions medically valid?
  - Does note style conform to institutional standards?

### üîÅ Iterative Optimization

1. Start with zero-shot LLM baseline + retrieval
2. Add retrieval filtering: confidence scores, section-specific document slices
3. Fine-tune LLM or switch to prompt-tuned instruction model
4. Add structure-aware validation rules: e.g., if "fever" exists, then "temperature" must be filled

## üß© Summary

This RAG system balances automation (via LLMs) and safety (via rule-based preprocessing + curated retrieval). With strong external retrieval and smart prompting, the system can produce reliable, personalized EMRs suitable for downstream QA or clinical use.
